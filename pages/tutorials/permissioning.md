Permissioning
=========================
Deepstream allows for every operation (creating or reading records, sending events, making RPCs etc.) to be permissioned individually for every user. This happens in the permissionHandler's `canPerformAction()` method. Every message needs to pass through here before it is processed.

`canPerformAction()` will be called with three arguments

* `username` is the username that was passed to the callback of `isValidUser()` (see the [authentication tutorial](authentication.html) for details.)
* `message` is a map with four fields: `topic`, `action`, `data` and `raw`
* `callback` is a function that should be called with two arguments: error (or null) and (boolean) `isAllowed`, e.g. `callback( null, true );`

### Messages
Permissions are based on incoming messages. Every incoming message will be parsed and validated for syntactical correctness, but won't be processed  until after it is permitted. Parsed messages look like this:

```javascript
{
	raw: 'R\u001fCR\u001fcurrencies',
	topic: 'R',
	action: 'CR',
	data: [ 'currencies' ]
}
```

* `topic` is a constant that defines what the message relates to, e.g. `RECORD`, `EVENT`, `RPC`, `AUTH` etc. Please find a full list of topics [here](../docs/constants.html#Topic)
* `action` is a constant that defines what should happen to the topic, e.g. 'CREATE_OR_READ', 'SUBSCRIBE', 'DELETE' etc. Please find a full list of actions [here](../docs/constants.html#Actions)
* `data` is an array of values that relate to the action. The number and order of these values depends on the action they relate to. For every record-related message the first value in the data array is always the record name

If you'd like to learn more about deepstream's message structure, have a look at the [message structure page](../info/messagestructure)

### Applying permissions
Based on the username and the incoming message you can now allow or deny operations. Here are some examples:


### Allow everything
To allow everything, just always pass true to the callback. This is also what the default permissionHandler does.

```javascript
//Allow everything
canPerformAction: function( username, message, callback ) {
	callback( null, true );
}
```

### Prevent a specific user from deleting records
To prevent user `LisaA` from deleting any records, do the following

```javascript
canPerformAction: function( username, message, callback ) {
	var isAllowed = (
		username === 'LisaA' &&
		message.topic === server.constants.TOPIC.RECORD &&
		message.action === server.constants.ACTIONS.DELETE
	);

	callback( null, isAllowed );
}
```

### Private records
Sometimes it is useful to create records that can only be created, read or manipulated by a specific user. To do this, simply enforce the name of the logged in user as part of the recordname:

```javascript
canPerformAction: function( username, message, callback ) {
	// Allow every non record-related message
	if( message.topic !== server.constants.TOPIC.RECORD ) {
		callback( null, true );
	}
	else {
		var recordName = message.data[ 0 ];
		callback( null, recordName.indexOf( username ) !== -1 );
	}
}
```

### Validating against record data
In the next example we'll prevent the value of 'price' for record 'fancyCar' from being set to less than 60,000. Performing checks for specific record values can be a bit tricky for two reasons:

* Record data can be set in two different ways, depending if the user set the entire record, using `record.set( value )` or just a path within it, using `record.set( path, value )`.<br />`record.set( value )` triggers an `UPDATE` operation and the `data` array will contain [ recordName, version, JSON-encoded-record ].<br />`record.set( path, value )` triggers a `PATCH` operation and the `data` array will contain [ recordName, version, path, typed-value ].

* All deepstream messages are strings. To tell the server about their original datatype, the client prefixes certain values (e.g. for PATCH operations, event and rpc data) with an extra character. This means that `42` turns to `N42`. These can be converted back to their original value using `deepstream.convertTyped( value )`.

```javascript
canPerformAction: function( username, message, callback ) {
	// Allow every message that isn't a change to the fancy car record
	if(
		message.topic === deepstream.constants.TOPIC.RECORD &&
		message.data[ 0 ] === 'fancyCar' && (
			message.action === deepstream.constants.ACTIONS.PATCH ||
			message.action === deepstream.constants.ACTIONS.UPDATE
		)
	) {
		if( message.action === deepstream.constants.ACTIONS.PATCH ) {
			var price = deepstream.convertTyped( message.data[ 3 ] );
		} else {
			var price = message.data[ 2 ].price;
		}

		if( isNaN( price ) ) {
			callback( 'price is not a number' );
		} else {
			callback( null, price >= 60000 )
		}
	} else {
		callback( null, true );
	}
}
```
